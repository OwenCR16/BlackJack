# BlackJack

##Description
A basic C# application that plays the classic card game BlackJack, and uses Bananas as currency.

##Features
The program uses OOP for a deck of individual cards, each with its own rank, suit and value (in order to develop more games in the future with the same framework). The player plays against a dealer that must hit until they reach a total of 17 or more. 

##How to use
Download and run the .exe file to play.
